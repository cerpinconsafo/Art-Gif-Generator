# Art Gif Generator
----
This webpage utilizes the GIPHY rest API, as well as jQuery to generate dynamic user-inputed content.  Users are able to search for Gifs based on their own keywords, or the pre-defined buttons, at the top of the page.  The users can create their own buttons by inputing text into the search bar, thus allowing all visitors to 'share' their own unique searches with others.
